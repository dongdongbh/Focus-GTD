# Weekly Review

The Weekly Review is the **secret weapon** of GTD. It keeps your system trusted and current.

> "If you don't have a Weekly Review discipline, you simply won't trust your system past a couple of days." — David Allen

## Why Weekly Review?

Without regular review:
- Lists get stale
- Trust erodes
- Captured items pile up
- Projects stall
- Stress returns

With weekly review:
- System stays current
- Mind stays clear
- Nothing falls through cracks
- You engage with confidence

---

## When to Review

**Schedule:** Same time, same day each week
**Popular times:**
- Friday afternoon (end the work week clean)
- Saturday/Sunday morning (start fresh)

**Duration:** 30-90 minutes

> **Tip:** You can set a recurring reminder for your Weekly Review in **Settings → Notifications**. Use this to protect your review time.

## The Mindwtr Review Wizard

Mindwtr provides a guided weekly review. Access it from:
- **Desktop:** Weekly Review in sidebar
- **Mobile:** Review tab or drawer

### Step 1: Process Inbox

**Goal:** Inbox Zero

Review each inbox item:
1. Is it actionable?
2. What's the next action?
3. Clarify and organize

**In Mindwtr:**
- See your inbox count
- Process items using the clarify workflow
- Empty the inbox completely

### Step 2: Review Calendar

**Look back 14 days:**
- Did you miss anything?
- Any completed appointments need follow-up?
- Capture new actions that arose

**Look ahead 14 days:**
- What's coming up?
- What preparation is needed?
- Capture any new tasks

**In Mindwtr:**
- Review the Calendar view
- Check past and upcoming events
- Add any needed actions

### Step 3: Waiting For

**Review delegated items:**
- Have you received what you're waiting for?
- Do you need to send a reminder?
- Update notes with latest status

**In Mindwtr:**
- View all waiting tasks
- Follow up on stale items
- Move completed items to Done

### Step 4: Review Projects

**For each active project:**
- Does it have at least one next action?
- Is it still relevant?
- Has it been completed?

**In Mindwtr:**
- See projects with/without next actions
- Add next actions where missing
- Mark completed projects as Done

### Step 5: Someday/Maybe

**Review incubated items:**
- Do you want to activate any?
- Should any be deleted?
- Are any still relevant?

**In Mindwtr:**
- Browse Someday/Maybe list
- Promote items to Next Actions
- Archive or delete stale items

### Complete

**You're ready for the week ahead:**
- All inboxes empty
- Calendar reviewed
- Projects have next actions
- Lists are current
