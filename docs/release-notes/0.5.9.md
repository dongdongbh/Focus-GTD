# Mindwtr 0.5.9

## Highlights
- Mobile inbox processing is more reliable and supports #tags alongside @contexts.
- Mobile search now opens the exact project/task you tapped.
- Linux desktop adds a window decorations toggle and a scrollable sidebar.

## Desktop
- Add a Linux-only “Window decorations” toggle in Settings → General.
- Sidebar list is scrollable on small windows; collapsed header looks cleaner.
- Esc now blurs the quick-add input for faster keyboard workflows.
- Search results for project tasks always open the project view.
- Text direction selection now saves correctly.
- Checklist editing: Backspace removes empty items and keeps focus moving.
- List views update immediately after edits without a refresh.

## Mobile
- Inbox processing queue stays open and continues through all tasks.
- Inbox processing distinguishes @contexts vs #tags (tags are stored in tags, not contexts).
- Search results open the target project and highlight/open the task.
- Contexts screen supports multi-select filtering (AND match) and toggle-to-unselect.
- Added safe-area padding for Android nav bars in Settings, Review, Board, Waiting, Someday, and Reference.
- Sync folder selection now validates writability and shows a clear read-only message.
